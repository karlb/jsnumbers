JSNumbers
A Javascript puzzle game by Karl Bartel <karlb@gmx.net>
License: GPL

The game can be run by opening game.html from a webserver. Opening the file directly from disk will cause errors, since the game loads the levels via XMLHTTP-Request ("AJAX"), which is not possible on the local disc.

Contents:
	game.html -- the HTML and JS used to run the game
	levels -- JSON files which are loaded via XMLHTTP-Request
	img -- images files use by the game
	source-data -- data files from which the images in img are generated
